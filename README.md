## Introduction 
Our project is a movie rating app that allows users to rate and review movies, as well as discover new films based on their interests. The app is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly find the information they need.

One of the key features of the app is its rating system, which allows users to rate movies on a scale of one to five stars. Users can also leave reviews and comments about the movies they have seen, providing valuable insights and recommendations for other users.
